Also, article 6 of the Protocol ''on transitional provisions'' annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon provided that on the date of the entry into force of the Treaty, the terms of office of the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy and of the Deputy Secretary General of the Council ceased, with the Council electing a Secretary General. <a href=\"http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf\">http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf</a> register.consilium.europa.euampamp",
